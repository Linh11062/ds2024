Designing the RPC Service:

- Define the remote procedures that the client and server will use to transfer files. 
- Determine the input and output parameters for each remote procedure. 
  For file transfer, you'll need to consider parameters like the file name, file data, file size, etc.
- Decide on the transport protocol to use for RPC communication, such as TCP/IP or UDP.

Organizing the System:

- Place the modified server and client code files.
- Create additional files for implementing the RPC service, such as rpc_server.c and rpc_client.c.
