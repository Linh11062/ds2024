Designing the MPI Service:

- Define the MPI service that enables communication and file transfer between processes. 
  MPI provides various communication functions like MPI_Send, MPI_Recv, and collective operations like MPI_Bcast.
- Determine the communication patterns and operations required
- Design a suitable MPI service architecture, illustrating the interactions between processes. 
  Create a figure to visualize the MPI service design in the report.

Organizing the System:

- Modify server.c and implement the MPI server functionality.
- Modify client.c and implement the MPI client functionality.
- Ensure effective collaboration and communication to coordinate the development tasks.
