Protocol Design:
The protocol for file transfer over TCP/IP in our system follows approach:

1. Client establishes a connection with the server.
2. Client sends a request to the server to initiate the file transfer.
3. Server acknowledges the request and prepares to send the file.
4. Server reads the file from its storage and sends it to the client in chunks.
5. Client receives the file chunks from the server and reconstructs the complete file.
6. Once the file transfer is complete, the client sends an acknowledgment to the server.
7. Server receives the acknowledgment and closes the connection.

System Organization:
Two main components: the server and the client. 
The server component is responsible for listening for incoming connections, handling file transfer requests, 
and sending the file to the client. 
The client component is responsible for initiating the connection, requesting the file transfer, 
receiving the file chunks, and acknowledging the successful transfer.
